![robot-image](https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/practice-assignments/blob/master/Obstacle-Avoidance-Using-Ros-Gazebo/assets/obstacle-avoidance-using-ros-and-gazebo.png)

1. Create a URDF model of the above differential drive robot
2. Simulate the designed robot in Gazebo
3. Add Laser scanner on the top of the robot
4. Create a ROS node to perform obstacle avoidance using the values from the laser scanner

### Implementation details

1. Write the code in both cpp and python
2. Design using gui as well as xacro
